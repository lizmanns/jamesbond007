  	<p>The 007 Museum was founded in 1996 by Guntar Walker. He has taken James Bond souvenirs
	   and relics from all over the world and put them up for display in his galleries. He collects
		everthing from cars and aircrafts from the movie, to bullet-shaped shot glasses and martini glasses
		for crafting the perfect Vesper Martini. He even hosts parties that serve as an reanactment of the films.
		During these parties, guests can gamble with actual poker chips and witness James Bond himself (Gunter dressed
		as him)spying on his enemies. And, of course, merchandise is offered in an array of t-shirts, glassware, and posters. It's the perfect setting to feel like you are a spy in one of the films for an evening. </p>
